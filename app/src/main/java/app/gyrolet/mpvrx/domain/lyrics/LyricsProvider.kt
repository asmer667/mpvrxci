/**
 * Online lyrics databases the repository can ask, in default priority order.
 *
 * Declaration order is the priority inside one quality tier. Every provider is
 * contacted together; actual word-timed lyrics beat line-timed lyrics, which
 * beat plain text. When two providers return the same timing quality, the one
 * declared first wins. The picker uses this order too.
 *
 * [wordSynced] describes provider capability for UI and diagnostics. Automatic
 * selection inspects the returned lyrics because a capable provider can still
 * return a line-synced fallback for one particular track.
